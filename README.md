## **<ins>Introduction</ins>**
This is the third of my milestone projects, as part of the Code Institute full stack developer course. The project is a car maintenance tracking tool. It has a front end using Flask framework, 
with Materlize CSS library for the majority of the styling. The project also contains, custom HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

## **<ins>Project_Motivation</ins>**

The car maintenance tracker site is designed to be an application that allows organisations or individuals to record and track maintenance carried out on their vehicles.
The system has two aspects to it;
1. User Side. <br>
    The user would have the ability to register a car(s) and input maintenance records for that car. 
2. Admin Side. <br>
    The administrator would have the ability to add Garages (which are approved for use) and deactivate them from user view if required. 

The concept was to create an application, that was easy to use, accessible on all device types and would require minimum training for users. 

## **<ins>UX</ins>**
For the UX, I choose the Materialize CSS library for the primary CSS elements, applying custom CSS where required. The design of the applications, was a minimalist design on white background. 
As the application is a functional one I felt the simpler design with minimal graphics was best. The app is used to input data (records), edit and view the records so I don't expect the 
user to be on the site longer than is necessary for them to complete the task. 
In the base HTML, a common header and footer is used, across all the pages, the only element that varies are the page links depending on the user type and session cookie. 

### <ins>User_Stories</ins>

**Fleet Owner;**
1. Having a fleet of company cars, I want a single tool, where all the maintenance records are logged.
2. Company cars are operated by employees, service & maintenance is arranged by employee, so they system should allow for the employee to input the records & update records.
3. There is a list of approved garages where service and maintenance can be carried out, a list of the garages should be available to the employee when entering the record and the list should be able to be updated by the admin. 

**Record Owner;**
1. Simple form when entering data. 
2. Ability to register a car to the system.
3. View the records entered by me, with the ability to view, edit & delete as required. 

**Site Administrator Owner;**
1. Ability to view all records entered in to the system. 
2. Access to add garages or edit the current list in the DB.
3. Ability to edit or delete records if required from the system.

### <ins>Wireframes</ins>

## <ins>Testing</ins>

### <ins>UX_Testing</ins>
As part of the UX testing all pages were tested for the following criteria;
1. All pages renders on the device, with no obvious distortion.
2. All colours and text is consistent and displays well to the user
3. All links within the page work as expected
4. All fields, that should be accessible for editing / adding data work as expected
5. Any buttons on the page are accessible and displayed appropriately for the screen size.
6. Any other issues the tester sees related to UX. 

| Page | Desktop | Tablet | Mobile | Issues |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| register | Pass | Pass | Pass | Link below register box failed on live site, link was for git pot test site.|
| login | Pass | Pass | Pass | Link below register box failed on live site, link was for git pot test site.||
| tracker | Pass | Pass | Pass | Some modifications were made to better display the lists. One column was removed from the list of records for display on mobile to improve the lay out|
| detailed information |Pass |Pass | Pass |The cards on the top of the page, were different sizes depending on the data from the record, set a min height to ensure they all remain the same height.|

| edit record | Pass | Pass | Pass ||
| manage garages | Pass | Pass | Pass ||
| add car | Pass |Pass | Pass | spelling error on text above form.|
| user profile |Pass | Pass | Pass ||

**Note:** Early in testing, it was obvious that there were issues with the site on a table device. 
Testing was suspended and all pages were updated with addition size for medium devices to improve the layout on a tablet device. 
Testing, was resumed after this fix was applied to all pages.

## <ins>Deployment</ins>
The live version of the site is deployed on Heroku (free cloud account) or as an alternate you can create a copy and run the app locally.

### <ins>Live_Deployment</ins>
I choose Heroku as the cloud platform to deploy the project. 
- At www.heroku.com, you can create a free account. 
- Once you have your account set-up, create an app on Heroku (will require a unique name).
- Link the app, to you git repository for the project, you can connect to your git and search for the repository. 
- I chose to set my app to automatically deploy, meaning any update pushed to git auto deploys on Heroku. 
- In the settings tab, you need to add the config variables, (IP / DB / URI / Port  Secret_Key) mirroring what’s in the env.py file.

### <ins>Local_Deployment</ins>

To Clone the repository;
From the Github repository (@ https://github.com/meltaylor78/car_maintenance_tracker)
- click on the code button <img src="/assets/readmeAssets/Code_button.jpg"> and copy the link provided.
- In a Terminal or IDE
- Change the directory to the desired location on your drive
- Type git clone, followed by the url you copied above
Note: as an alternate, Git also allows the repository to be downloaded as a zip file.

## **<ins>Database</ins>**
The application, would require a database backend, I chose mongoDB for the project. 
The database has four collections within it;

**Directory;**

The directory collection holds all the user data, records are created when a user registers on the site.
Data in the collection;
- Name
- e-mail address
- user Name
- password (stored in hashed format for security)

**Cars;**

The cars collections, holds data on cars registered on the site. Users can register their cars and only registered cars are available to create maintenance records for.
Data in the collection;
- Car Registration
- make
- model
- user
- e-mail
Note: user & e-mail are auto populated to the DB based on logon user at the time of registration.


**Garage;**

The garages collection has a list of garages that can be used when creating a record. Only the Admin can add or edit the list of garages. 
Data in the collection;
- Garage Name
- Garage Contact Name
- Garage Contact Phone No.
- Garage Status (active, when available for selection by user)


**Maintenance;**

The maintenance collection is populated with the records created by users. 
Data in the collection;
- Car Registration (user can only select pre-registered cars under their username)
- Car make - Populated from Car collection based on reg number selected
- Car Model - same as car make.
- username - based on the user logged when the record is created
- Service Date - user input as the time of record creation
- Service cost - user input as the time of record creation
- Service Paid - user input as the time of record creation, can be yes / no
- Service Description -  - user input at the time of record creation short description of service
- Odometer Reading  - user input as the time of record creation
- Garage Name - selected from list of active garages in garage collection
- Garage Contact - populated from Garage collection based on reg number selected
- Garage Phone No. - as garage name above
